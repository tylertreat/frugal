/**
 * FAsyncCallback is an internal callback which is constructed by generated code

 * appropriate callback. FAsyncCallback is passed an in-memory TTransport which
 * wraps the complete message. The callback returns an error or throws an
 * exception if an unrecoverable error occurs and the transport needs to be
 * shutdown.
